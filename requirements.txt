# Project requirements for modified_deepsort


# Core numeric and image libraries
numpy>=1.19.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
Pillow>=7.0.0

# Deep learning frameworks
torch>=1.8.0
torchvision>=0.9.0
# tensorflow==1.15.0

# Scientific and ML utilities
scipy>=1.4.0
scikit-learn>=0.22.0
# pandas>=1.0.0

# Utilities
tqdm>=4.40.0
trackeval>=1.0.0

# Optional: if using YOLOv5 detector runner which may require extra deps
# yolov5 uses PyYAML, seaborn, etc. Install only if needed.
# pyyaml

# Notes:
# - If you only want to run the tracker with precomputed .npy detections,
#   you can avoid installing TensorFlow by skipping the detection generation
#   step (place .npy files in deep_sort/resources/detections/).
# - For GPU acceleration install the appropriate CUDA-enabled PyTorch and
#   TensorFlow builds for your system.
